I might agree with some generally, because that's how I feel most games I play work, but that's not necessarily true for every game. Most caregorical statements depend on the genre and style of the game being made. In game design, one size does not fit all.

Some games are better for breaking from convention. E.g. ""The game is a collaborative endeavour with shared narrative responsibility and authority between the players and the game master"" -- I think this is generally somewhat true for most RPGs, but the degree to which it is true can vary wildly from game to game. The role and degree of player authority is much smaller in a typical 'trad' game, or many OSR games, than in some modern narrative games, for example. But neither is worse.

""The player should be able to decide when their character dies."" is another game-specific judgment. There are games designed this way, and it often works for them. There are games that would break if designed this way. Both can be fun, and neither preclude the possibility of their inverse being equally fun.",,4,2,5,Four to eight players,Between two to four players,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not advocating my way above all others but there is a lot going on in the RPG scene these days (ie social justice stuff) that I find highly irritating and off putting. It's amazing that D&D thrived back in the 80s when we didn't have these concerns. The game was just fine and it was very popular.

One of the things that turned me off so much about D&D 3e was that there were way too many rules. 

As far as story is concerned, the DM creates a campaign world (or uses a pre-existing one) and presents the players with options (is hooks). The players, through their actions, then write the story of the campaign. I have no desire to play through some DMs failed novel ideas masking as a campaign story.

Keep real world stuff out of roleplaying. I have to deal with enough BS every day in real life. I don't want to deal with that when I'm trying to play a RPG",,2,1,3,Five to six players,Seven to eight players,Not regular enough to have a set day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, a lot of games aren't stress-tested at high levels so the mechanics break down after a long campaign.","If we're reducing this to an established system that really turns my particular crank (so to speak), I think Gumshoe is one of my favorites. I love investigative games, and Gumshoe not only has a workable system for the players but provides a good framework for the GM to build mysteries. Nights Black Agents and Trail of Cthulhu are two of the best, though Mutant City Blues is up there, too. 

PbtA games tend to hit close to the level of table collaboration I like, but in practice PbtA is a design philosophy more than a system and the examples out there are sort of hit or miss. For every brilliant one (Bluebeard's Bride, Monsterhearts) you get a mediocre one (Bedlam Hall) or a downright stinker (Dead Scare). Running and playing PbtA also requires a pretty big paradigm shift for longtime roleplayers of trad games like D&D, GURPS, etc., and some people fall right into it, some people just get can't their brains around it. When it works, though, it's produced some of the best games I've played.

Moving away from games with widespread systems, I think Chill 3rd Ed is one of my favorites. I like games that include tactical elements but aren't reliant on pure numbers. D&D, for example, tends to be about what makes your numbers higher, but get into a game like NOVA or Feng Shui and it's also about which tactics to use and how to apply narrative pressure. (Mind, my experience with D&D 5th is limited, so it might be different now.)

My ideal system, at the end of the day, is one that this particular table of people likes, understands, and can engage with. I really like the Cypher System, for instance, but a lot of my players just haven't been able to get their heads around it, so regardless of how I feel about it, running it can be a slog.","Oh, I have *so much* commentary on TTRPG systems. ",,1001+,3,5,3,2,1,4,,1,"Most of my 3 answers kind of cook down to ""depends what the game wants to do."" Some games try to emulate the ""reality"" of a world; rolling to pick a lock is about Dexterity. Some games frame challenge in terms of narrative; rolling to pick a lock is about getting past this particular obstacle and what the stakes of failure are. Either approach is valid, the key point to me is that the game knows what it's trying to do and the mechanics are consistent within itself. (Helps if the game text isn't up its own butt about it.)","Chill 3rd Ed, Fate Accelerated, Atlantis: Second Age, Cairn (Soul Jar, not the OSR one), Pugmire, and various others",3,2,3,Five to six players,Five to six players,"Monday, Saturday",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the degree that the rules support this they are useful.  I prefer Rules that support the setting and the themes of the game and pretty much all rules should be homebrewed, modified, etc. as necessary to facilitate this.  Since I want to discover the game world and want it to feel ""real"" and alive, I strongly dislike systems like FitD in which it's fully in the players' faces that most everything is being made up on the spot.  I also really dislike the mantra that I often see in 5e D&D circles that the RAW are sacrosanct and any DM who changes them is toxic and doing it to take away player agency and ruin the game.  

I think that both of these (group narration and strict adherence to RAW) are an attempt to codify away bad game mastering.  They represent a response to railroading and other forms of bad GM'ing that remove player agency.  This is far too common in adventures published by large game companies as well as homebrewed campaigns.  It's an example of poor adventure/campaign design, rather than poorly designed rules (at least much of the time).  Trying to fix it by focusing on the rules can only be of limited success IMO.

Both of these approaches may work to some extent and, when it comes to narrative play ala FitD/PbtA, may also offer a new type of game experience that appeals to some players.  Still, in both cases, I think there's a largely false belief that bad GM's are bad because of bad rules, when in fact a toxic GM is likely to be toxic regardless of the rules if they aren't taught how to be better.  In my opinion, more focus should be placed on figuring out why bad GM's are bad and how to help them improve rather than deifying ""group narrative"" play or the RAW.

Just like a combat shouldn't occur unless there's a chance for player death or loss of resources, you shouldn't have an in-character conversation unless there's a chance to change your relationship with an NPC, or to meaningfully discover more about that character through roleplaying, or there's information that would be dramatic or important to reveal, nor should you have exploration or encumbrance or random encounters in a game where those stakes don't affect the world in any meaningful way. I'm not so much a fan of idle in-character conversation for the sake of it.

Roleplaying is heavily important. I like seeing players portray their characters, and making decisions on their behalf that reveal things about the way they think, behave, feel, and change over time. However, I don't think ""character arcs"" or ""story"" should be planned, but should be an emergent feature based on the rules of the game (much in the style of OSR). Sometimes, a character's story is that they were an overeager adventurer who got killed by a scythe trap. That's still meaningful and fun to explore.

Character stables are more important than people think. People should be able to have as many characters as they would like, and play whichever one is fun for them each session. Why play in a campaign for nine months using a character you've grown to dislike?

Open-table RPGs should become the new standard for tabletop gaming. Having a permanent group of 5-6 players is an extreme commitment. It can lead to people feeling obligated to play when they're not interested, and it can be hard to schedule. Plus, it guarantees that it's harder to introduce new players; either the group will be too large and they will not get invited, or they will see a ""once weekly"" commitment and become too intimidated to ever try playing. If people treated RPGs as casually as they did board games, then we would see a massive boom in the community.",,4,1,2,Between two to four players,"Open table.

We all knew who would not tolerate being second place, or losing, or being insulted. This trust and appreciation worked both ways from DM to players and back. We could sort out any disagrement fairly quickly. Those not satisfied could go put it in their diary (for which one friend created a DM BS list which is funny even today because.. we're human and fallible). In the past years, after many moves and experiences, I have had to get used to the notion of groups forming through social media wihthout the same personal history. It changes so much about the game, especially conflict resolution.

Parry, dodge, and toughness also allow characters to avoid damage which gives the DM and players many options in play and character creation. Skills should be kept within a certain limit. 15 simple skills that everyone can roll for, plus another 10 or 15 advanced skills that require training to use at all, plus the option to add custom skills such as knowledges, crafting specializations, or weird exotic things that players want to be proficient in.

The feats should also have multiple levels so that another feat can be spent to upgrade it.",I hope things get better.

Please stop making your games have that many editions. Old man yells at cloud.,,201-500,1,5,2,3,2,5,,2,"1. I think the question about the mechanics and setting of a game arises from a false premise; I don’t think that the setting and mechanics of a game should ever be in conflict in the first place.
2. I think it is better to seek out an /existing/ new system rather than refluffing, short of circumstances where the system lines up perfectly but the setting differs (e.g., D&D for a high-magic, high-fantasy, high-combat, high-power setting like Elder Scrolls).
3. I think the combat-heavy vs. combat-light question asks the wrong question. There are certain genres where combat should be something frequent, if not ever-present (high fantasy, Westerns, etc.), and likewise games that should have combat rarely, if ever (slice-of-life school drama, Ghibli-esque, etc.). None of these are inherently superior to the other, and I think it boils down to the types of settings that one prefers. For my part, I tend to prefer settings that are combat-heavy, but I would not want to play a combat-heavy Ryuutama; it just doesn’t fit.
4. I agree that metagaming is bad, but I think the sticky part of it is defining what constitutes metagaming. I see posts on Reddit constantly where people ask if something is metagaming, and it ends up being the player using critical thinking skills.

Individual tables can develop a rhythm that helps work past this, but it is an inherent limitation in the system as it exists today.

Many games are D&D 5e clones, others aggressively designed in opposition to 5e, but few feel tailored to the specific needs of the story that game is designed to tell. In this way, generic systems end up feeling more valid because at least they have consistency upon which you could homebrew tailored rules, but I'd like to see more games with design intentionally tailored to the setting/theme/genre they're going for, even if those features are optional.","A solid, simple, and flexible foundation upon which variety can be built, with optional features and rules to include or exclude based on the group, setting, narrative, and simple preference. It would have an emphasis on player choice, but character skill progression. This is perhaps why I'm so enamored of the AGE system games from Green Ronin at the moment. They strike a good, but not perfect, balance here.","There seems to be a lot of doomsaying around D&D falling out of favor with the larger community, claiming it somehow marks the end of a golden age. It may slow the influx of new players to have the market more divided, but I think in the long run this fuck up on WotC's part has opened the floodgates for variety and experimentation that was previously pushed down by the forces of capitalism.

First, I feel that the capacity for character variety makes a system stronger, so characters both like and unlike me, with skills I do or do not have. This means that inherently players need to alter their actions to suit the character in order to effectively play that character in a satisfying way (within a positive group dynamic, of course). Second, I believe that the enjoyment had at the table for all players, including the GM, is a shared responsibility across all players. Not every session will be super-fun-shenanigans every time, but there's a difference between mandatory fun and enjoyably engaging. Finally, I am very mixed on the questions of GM authority and systemic requirements. I'm a big fan of using the correct tool for the job and reaching outside one's comfort zone (ie - don't just use D&D 5e for everything), but I do believe the whole group including the GM should work together to determine which system, narrative, and most importantly limitations are suited to make their collective experience both respectful and enjoyably engaging.","Adventure Game Engine games (Fantasy Age 2e, Modern Age, etc)",5,1,3,Five to six players,Five to six players,Not regular enough to have a set day,3,4,One player taking all the spotlight,4,4,3,5,3,4,3,"I'm always trying to improve my ability to collaboratively build the story with my players. I do a lot of worldbuilding as a hobby on its own and so I sometimes get a bit too deep in my own head and have to remind myself that I'm not telling a story to the players but rather helping improv a story together. It's a bit of a narrow path to have a plot that will engage them and help them drive forward while keeping it open to their choices. Too far one way and you're railroading them, too far the other and they'll never do shit. I was getting pretty good at it, I like to think, but then my group fell into the inevitable scheduling pit and I feel very out of practice now. ","I can always use more advice on how to engage the players in a narrative we build together. As I mentioned above, it's easy to railroad players into a story of your own devising, but they tend to get disinterested without seeing tangible effects of their choices. Of course, if you leave them with too little to act upon they'll mill around doing nothing until they get bored and stop coming. I've consumed a lot of GM content on YouTube and the like speaking to that effect, but more insights are always welcome, especially with players' expectations frequently set extremely high by celebrity GM's like Mercer and Mulligan.",5,5,Scheduling problems,

For the good of the whole, sometimes people have to be turned down... even though that can really suck :/

2. The best systems (in my mere mortal opinion) FACILITATE instead of dictate. They allow for a framework of fairness and resolution, but they otherwise stay the hell out of the way of narrative & roleplaying as much as reasonably possible. They allow for varied characters instead of pigeon-holed archetypes, and the role of policing game balance ought to be largely left to the GM instead of being hamfistedly imposed by convoluted system mechanics

3. Good GMs work to keep player investment high in their games. Sometimes this means fudging things to allow for newer characters to survive long enough to be established, and sometimes this means following through on the dangerous setting elements which threaten player characters with death if they do something recklessly foolish. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to keeping player immersion/investment high. It requires knowing your players and knowing your game's universe & narratives to deliver a consistent enough experience which is also FUN for the people you have... including yourself.

In a world increasingly devoid of close relations, community and general togetherness, I think Tabletop roleplaying games have the potential to protect the human spirit, to allow it to flourish, and to bring all sorts of different people together...Mainly massive nerds though :P  ",,201-500,4,3,3,4,3,4,,3,"Everyone has their own opinions on the 'best' way to play, but for me a careful balance between fun, drama, narrative and mechanical satisfaction can be usually held with the GM being sensitive to narrative, open to suggestions or ideas from their players, fair in rulings, but not afraid to bend the rules, or even fluff a roll, if it makes for a better narrative.  The trick is to keep your players believing in the narrative imperative and its power, to surprise them as much as to give them the satisfaction of their expectations.

In short, being a good GM is like being a skillful author, a good referee, and a receptive but focused director.

For me personally, I'm a performer and creative and I play with a lot of creatives, so I really love the feeling of doing what I do, but with the relaxed and playful setting of the RPG table, not the stressful dedication to our various creative endeavors we all engage in.

","Elegant character generation with high customisation potential and meaningful development (building characters is basically a second, shadow game to me).

","So much, but here are a few things. Everything needed to play and GM should be in one book. Supplements are fine, but should not be required.

World-building requires way more tools than it does text. Genre is gestural and built on simple tropes that can become more specific in action: let the mechanics and character builds support genre without spelling everything out.

I hate rolls for persuasion that break immersion. Players good arguments and reasonable actions should not be blocked by arbitrary rolls. Rolls should only be used in places of uncertainty to build tension.

 Hot take: combat (at least in D&D) is BORING. I also don't enjoy looking for random objects in a world I can't see. 

 Building out player relationships in character creation makes games more fun and dynamic (see Die). A system should fit the type of play and story you want to tell. You may be able to modify an existing one. You may not. Eg. I wanted a healing/narrative centered game. While D&D has some healing skills it is mechanically unfit for that type of play b/c of it's focus on combat and hit points.

The methods of setting complexity and difficulty are very challenging.  A good example would be that DnD (might) be improved for example if the DC had an automatic trigger for proficiency... Changing the DC by a certain amount.  Of course this is a bit difficult to implement because it relies on DM prerogative to much to work in many groups... 🤷‍♂️","Love spending time growing with friends.
